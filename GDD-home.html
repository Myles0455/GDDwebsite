            <p class="displayed-content"> At GDD we focus on collaboration between programmers and artists to
                create games using the same tools as professional developers. We 
                need artists, musicians, programmers, and writers to bring these 
                projects to life! Best of all, no experience required. We’re here 
                for experts to noobies and everything in between, whether you have 
                a project you want to work on or are just interested in learning.</br></br>
                "In addition, we have a variety of local professional developers and
                artists who come speak to us, answer questions, and to tell us about 
                their real world experiences. If you're looking for professional 
                connections and resources in Game Development and Design, this is the 
                club for you!</br>
                (If it isn't obvious, we’re really proud of our club)</br></br>
                Keep an eye for this year's changes. For starters, our name change from GDC to GDD </br>
                to branch Game Development to all aspects of Design, and to be more inclusive to our </br>
                wonderful artists. In addition, watch out for our new logos, soon to be available as </br>
                stickers. Our club this semester will focus on our fantastic community and professional </br>
                development. If you're looking for an avenue to explore professional Game Development and </br>
                Design while being apart of a supportive community, come check us out!</br></br>
